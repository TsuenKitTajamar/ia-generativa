    "# 1. Collect Wikipedia data about Olympic Games 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of this project is to create a question answering model, based on a few paragraphs of provided text. Base GPT-3 models do a good job at answering questions when the answer is contained within the paragraph, however if the answer isn't contained, the base models tend to try their best to answer anyway, often leading to confabulated answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a model which answers questions only if there is sufficient context for doing so, we first create a dataset of questions and answers based on paragraphs of text. In order to train the model to answer only when the answer is present, we also add adversarial examples, where the question doesn't match the context. In those cases, we ask the model to output \"No sufficient context for answering the question\". \n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform this task in three notebooks:\n",
    "1. The first (this) notebook focuses on collecting recent data, which GPT-3 didn't see during its pre-training. We picked the topic of Olympic Games 2020 (which actually took place in the summer of 2021), and downloaded 713 unique pages. We organized the dataset by individual sections, which will serve as context for asking and answering the questions.\n",
    "2. The [second notebook](olympics-2-create-qa.ipynb) will utilize Davinci-instruct to ask a few questions based on a Wikipedia section, as well as answer those questions, based on that section.\n",
    "3. The [third notebook](olympics-3-train-qa.ipynb) will utilize the dataset of context, question and answer pairs to additionally create adversarial questions and context pairs, where the question was not generated on that context. In those cases the model will be prompted to answer \"No sufficient context for answering the question\". We will also train a discriminator model, which predicts whether the question can be answered based on the context or not."
