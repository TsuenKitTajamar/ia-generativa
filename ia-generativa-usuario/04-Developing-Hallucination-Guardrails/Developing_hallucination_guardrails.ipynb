        "\n",
        "1. Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether a response is accurate\n",
        "- It is important to break down this idea of \"truth\" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure\n",
        "- Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail\n",
        "2. Ensure consistency across key terminology\n",
        "- It is important to keep relevant terms such as knowledge base articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt\n",
        "- If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused\n",
        "3. Start with the most advanced model\n",
        "- There is a cost vs quality trade-off when using the most advanced models. Although GPT-4o may be more expensive, it is important to start with the most advanced model so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy\n",
        "- Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to gpt-3.5-turbo\n",
        "4. Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole\n",
        "- If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently\n",
        "- In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context\n",
        "\n",
        "With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance."
