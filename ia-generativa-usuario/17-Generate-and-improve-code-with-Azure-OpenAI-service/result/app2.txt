Sure! Here are four unit tests for the `absolute_square` function:

1. Test case: Both numbers are positive
   Input: `absolute_square(5, 3)`
   Expected output: `4`
   
2. Test case: Both numbers are negative
   Input: `absolute_square(-7, -4)`
   Expected output: `9`
   
3. Test case: One number is positive and the other is negative
   Input: `absolute_square(-2, 6)`
   Expected output: `64`
   
4. Test case: One number is zero
   Input: `absolute_square(0, 9)`
   Expected output: `81`

These test cases cover different scenarios to ensure that the function handles positive, negative, and zero values correctly.
